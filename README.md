-Major functionality
  For this project, we only specify the major functionality.  The design, architecture, and actual layout of the user interface is completely up to the developer.  Since this is an interview for a development position (not a graphical designer), strive for a user interface that is plain, but simple to use and that exposes all necessary functionality.
  
  We are not trying to judge your graphic design ability, so feel free to use default styles or styles from any major toolkit, like bootstrap.

-Report format
  The report should contain the following columns, formatted appropriately:
  Order ID
  Restaurant Name
  Runner Name
  Status
  Order Amount
  Tip Amount
  Orderer name
  Order date and time

-Functionality
  On opening the report, the user should see a simple tabular view with the columns above, for the last 1 week.  By default, the report is sorted on order datetime from newest to oldest.
  
  The user can sort the report on any column by clicking on it.
  
  There should be date fields allowing the user to specify a start and end date for the report and constrain or expand the date range.
  
  There should be a button to export the current data to a CSV file.
